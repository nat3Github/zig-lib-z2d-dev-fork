# z2d

A 2D graphics library, inspired by Cairo.

## About

z2d is a 2D graphics library, written in pure Zig. Its drawing model is
inspired by [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org), in that **paths** are used
to apply **sources** to **surfaces**.

This library is a massive work in progress, so consider this a pre-README. More
details, including examples and other usage instructions, will be added when we
actually have a fully usable model!
