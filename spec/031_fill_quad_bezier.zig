//! Case: Renders and fills quadratic beziers and degenerate curves (where one
//! of the control points is the same as the start or end point) on a 300x300
//! surface.
//!
//! This is a validation test against degenerate parts existing in the bezier,
//! since some of our control points are the same.
//!
//! Note that odd and even curves as defined below are shaped differently. This
//! is due to the fact that the first 2 sets of (x, y) co-ordinates that are
//! given to curveTo define the control points, and the current point (e.g.,
//! the one that you'd set with moveTo) and the final point are technically the
//! start and end points. Thus, to get a proper quadratic to what you'd expect,
//! you need the *control* points (so (x1, y1), (x2, y2)) to be equal.
